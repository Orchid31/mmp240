<h1>CHAPTER I.</h1>
<h2>Down the Rabbit-Hole</h2>
<p>Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of<br>
having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was<br>
reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it,<q cite="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rgs/alice-I.html">and what is the use of a book</q> <br>
thought Alice <q cite="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rgs/alice-I.html">without pictures or conversations.</q></p>

<p>So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made<br>
her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain<br>
would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a<br>
White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.</p>

<p>There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out<br>
of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, <q cite="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rgs/alice-I.html">Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!</q>
(when<br>
she thought it over afterwards,it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered<br>
at this,but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually <i class="latin">took<br>
a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket</i>, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started<br>
to her feet,for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit<br>
with either a waistcoat-pocket,or a watch to take out of it, and burning with<br>
curiosity, she ran across the field after it,and fortunately was just in time to see it<br>
pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.</p>
