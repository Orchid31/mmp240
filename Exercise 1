<p> I am a full-time student at BMCC and I major in Animation and Motion Pictures. I chose that major
  because I was always fascinated by cartoons and art in general. <br>My favorite
animated shows are Steven Universe, Bob's Burgers, Naurto,and Kid Cosmic. This
is my second year in BMCC.  I'm excited to enroll into Brooklyn College next year.
